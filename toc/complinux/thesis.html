<p>
The PhD writing experience for me went pretty smoothly and easily. 
But there were a few things in there that I thought was
worthwhile documenting. To look at exactly 
what I did, I've included my toplevel LaTeX file for the thesis
as <a href="thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a>. But I've included a few points
down below to explain some of the obstacles I hit along the way
and the way I resolved them.

</p><h3> Suggestions for breaking up the document.</h3>
<p>
I think it's a wise thing to actually break up the chapters into
different directories. For instance, my preliminaries are 
contained in a directory called "prelim." Then, I issue 
an \input directive as follows.

</p><p> 
\input{prelim/prelim}

</p><p>
In my case, the file prelim/prelim.tex itself contained input
directives of the form:

</p><p>
\input{prelim/mm}

</p><p>
This allowed me to very easily handle the entire document in a modular way, 
rather than making it difficult to manage single tex file.

</p><p>
NOTE: even though prelim.tex is sitting inside the prelim directory, 
I still needed the directory included in there when issuing
\input. I suspect this is because \input runs as a macro and it
is evaluated at the top level, rather than locally.

</p><h3>Equations/headings running beyond margins</h3>

LaTeX tries best to avoid introducing
too  much whitespace or splitting equations
(in environments like align) whenever it can 
be prevented. A result of this is that
either you get equations or headings 
running into the margins. 

<p> This issue is solved by 
telling LaTeX to be "sloppy" in the way it
deals with whitespace. Simply include

</p><p> \sloppy

</p><p> in the preamble of the document.
It is also advisable to split up
commas as separate maths delimiters. 
I.e., instead of

</p><p> $\spt X,\ \spt Y$, 

</p><p> write 

</p><p> $\spt X$, $\spt Y$. 

</p><p> In the former case, the entire block $..$
would get pulled to the next line if it were to 
run into the margin, whereas, in the second
situation, the line split would occur at the comma.

</p><h3>Huge gaps in the pages</h3>

Another formatting issue that often happens 
is the introduction of very large 
white space throught the document. This
happens because like to prevent the breakup 
of equations in environments like align
whenever it can - at the cost of introducing
vertical whitespace.

<p> One way to fix it is to include in
the preamble: 

</p><p>\raggedbottom

</p><p> which essentially says: keep the current behaviour
of not breaking up equations, but don't stretch equations.

</p><p> I found this to  be a suboptimal solution, 
because instead of the whitespace being spread throughout
the document, it becomes accumulated at the bottom,
which is a waste of paper and not very aesthetic.
Thus, the better solution was to tell
LaTeX to breakup equations. This was done by: 

</p><p>\allowdisplaybreaks[4]

</p><p> I found that 4 was the right level of break, but
you can, of course, experiment with this.
NOTE: Make sure you read over your document after doing this
because it may have mucked up the legibility of 
your equations.

</p><h3>Getting the eprint number field to appear
for ArXiV citations</h3>

I personally prefer to use the amsplain style for
bibliography, particularly because I just rip the 
BibTeX entry from <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet">MathSciNet</a>.
Similarly, you can do this for <a href="http://arxiv.org/">ArXiV</a>
preprints too, from the ADS database (lined via ArXiV).

<p> Obtaining the MathSciNet reference in this way has
the advantage that the MR number is displayed
in the citation, which makes it very easy to track down 
the paper, especially upon reading electronic copies.
ArXiV has a simlar Eprint number, specified 
by a field eprint in the BibTeX entry. Unfortunately,
the amsplain class doesn't know what to do with this.

</p><p> In the file <a href="aaplain.bst">aaplain.bst</a>, I've
hacked the amsplain BibTeX style file to use
the eprint field, so that the eprint number
preceded by EP is printed in the citation.
This file needs to simply be copied to the top
level directory of your thesis, and then
it can be used by specifying:

</p><p> \bibliography{aaplain}

</p><h3>Margins and the geometry package</h3>

ANU has a policy that the margins should at minimum be
2cm, and for odd pages 4cm on the left and even pages
4cm on the right.

<p> 
This can be achieved by using the geometry package
by including the following in the preamble:

</p><p>
\usepackage[a4paper, twoside, margin=20mm, marginsep=20mm]{geometry}
<br>
\geometry{top=20mm, bottom=20mm, inner=20mm, outer=40mm},

</p><p>
The only drawback here is that this geometry becomes 
forced on the titlepage as well. To get around this, 
you should omit the \geometry directive, and instead, 
use: 

\newgeometry{top=20mm, bottom=20mm, inner=20mm, outer=40mm}

</p><p>
*after* your titlepage, inside  the actual document.
NOTE: You cannot use \geometry inside the document, 
it needs to be used in the preamble.

</p><p>
You may find that this spits out an error, and that 
the geometry package shipped with your
system is missing the \newgeometry command. It seems that many texlive
distributions (at the time of writing) 
are missing the version 5 of the geometry
package, so you need to include 
 <a href="geometry.sty">geometry.sty</a>. 
If this doesn't work, see  
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/pkg/geometry">CTAN Geometry package</a>.

</p><p>
I also suggest that you use around 26mm for top and bottom margins, 
because the 20mm looks a bit artificially compressed. The 26mm is closer
to the latex default.

</p><p>Also, you can actually look at the "frame" of your geometry 
by issuing: 

</p><p> \geometry{showframe}

</p><p> in the preamble of the document.

</p><h3>Page numbering, and un-numbered chapter headings</h3>

I was adamant that page number 1 should correspond
to the first page of the Introduction, and I wanted all the preceding
pages to not have a page number. Also, I want sections like Introduction,
Acknowledgements, Abstract, etc. to not have a chapter number.

<p>
Here is a snippet from the top part of one of these Chapters: 
</p><p>\thispagestyle{empty} 
<br>\chapter*{Abstract}
<br>\thispagestyle{empty}

</p><p>The directives, \thispagestyle{empty} does the clearing
of the page numbers from the current page.
The * in \chapter* omits including this chapter in the
table of contents, and prevents allocating it a
chapter number.

</p><p>For the table of contents, the following is
what worked for me: 

</p><p>\thispagestyle{empty}
<br>\tableofcontents
<br>\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\thispagestyle{empty}}

</p><p>
The first \thispagestyle{empty} only seemed
to clear the page number on page 2, and
the weird \addtocontents... invocation
seemed to do it for page 1.

</p><h3>Preventing the printing of the 0 chapter number in the header</h3>

I didn't want my first chapter of the thesis to be 
"Introduction," so naturally, I did

<p>\chapter*{Introduction}

</p><p> But I wanted the Chapter name, "Introduction"
run on the header. This was done by issuing: 

</p><p>\chaptermark{INTRODUCTION}

</p><p> However, after doing this, I found that
it actually ran "0. INTRODUCTION" in the header. 
This was fixed by the following snippet of code
I ripped off somewhere on the internet: 

</p><p>\renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{%
<br> \ifnum\value{chapter}&gt;0
<br>    \markboth{\thechapter{}. #1}{}%
<br>  \else
<br>    \markboth{#1}{}%
<br>  \fi}

</p><p> which only enables the printing of the 
Chapter number for chapters larger than 0.


</p><h3>PDF, citation, referencing bookmarks</h3>

By using the hyperref package, PDF bookmarks and
linking to citations, etc. are automatically enabled. 
I encourage this strongly, because this 
produces an electronic document which is easier to navigate.

<p>
The reference links are default a box drawn aroudn the link. 
This can be made to look much better by using the following
in the premable: 

</p><p>\hypersetup{colorlinks}

</p><p>
Apart from that, another little trick is how to 
enable the chapters which have no chapter numbers
to be included in the PDF navigation bar.
This is achived via the \pdfbookmark command.
For the Abstract page example we gave in the
last section, we include the following up the top
of this section:

</p><p>\pdfbookmark{Abstract}{Chap:Abs}

</p><p>
I have no idea what the {Chap:Abs} does, but
I used a different name for each bookmark.

</p><p>
NOTE: Even though you don't have page numbers
showing up on these pages, it's very clumsy to have
arabic numeral numbers appearing
on the PDF navigation bar. For that reason,
before the titlepage, I would issue: 

</p><p> \pagenumbering{roman}

</p><p> 
and then before the start of the introduction,
switch to arabic: 

</p><p>\pagenumering{arabic}

</p><p>
Also, make sure that you issue: 

</p><p> \setcounter{page}{1}

</p><p>just prior to the Introduction.

</p><h3>Wrong page number displayed for bibliography,
index, and nomenclature</h3>

While the table of contents got all the page numbers
right, I noticed that the bibliography, index
and nomenclature links on the PDF index pane were all 
a few pages off.

<p> It seems that the \phantomsection command 
after a \cleardoublepage is the way to go to fix this.
For instance, this is how my index pages
were produced: 

</p><p>\cleardoublepage
<br>\phantomsection
<br>\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Index}
<br>\printindex


</p><h3>Long section title woes</h3>

Having long section titles can wreak havoc
in the header. One way to fix it is to specify: 

<p> 
\sectionmark{Short Section}

</p><p> Unfortunately, if the start of
this  long section falls on an odd page,
then the \sectionmark directive is ignored and
the long section name is used instead.

</p><p> The solution is to omit
the \sectionmark directive altogether and
instead define: 

</p><p> \section[Short Section]{Long Section Name Goes In Here}

</p><p> THe only problem with this is that "Short Section" is now
used in the table of contents rather than
"Long Section Name Goes In Here." This is fixed by 
including the following in the premable: 

</p><p> \usepackage[toctitles]{titlesec} 

</div>
