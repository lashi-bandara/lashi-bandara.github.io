<p>
The PhD writing experience for me went pretty smoothly and easily. 
But there were a few things in there that I thought was
worthwhile documenting. To look at exactly 
what I did, I've included my toplevel LaTeX file for the thesis
as <a href="thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a>. But I've included a few points
down below to explain some of the obstacles I hit along the way
and the way I resolved them.

</p><h3> Suggestions for breaking up the document.</h3>
<p>
I think it's a wise thing to actually break up the chapters into
different directories. For instance, my preliminaries are 
contained in a directory called "prelim." Then, I issue 
an \input directive as follows.

</p><p>
{% raw %}

\input{prelim/prelim}

{% endraw %} 

</p><p>
In my case, the file prelim/prelim.tex itself contained input
directives of the form:

</p><p>

{% raw %}

\input{prelim/mm}

{% endraw %} 

</p><p>
This allowed me to very easily handle the entire document in a modular way, 
rather than making it difficult to manage single tex file.

</p><p>
NOTE: even though prelim.tex is sitting inside the prelim directory, 
I still needed the directory included in there when issuing
{% raw %} \input {% endraw %}. I suspect this is because {% raw %} \input {% endraw %} runs as a macro and it
is evaluated at the top level, rather than locally.

</p><h3>Equations/headings running beyond margins</h3>

LaTeX tries best to avoid introducing
too  much whitespace or splitting equations
(in environments like align) whenever it can 
be prevented. A result of this is that
either you get equations or headings 
running into the margins. 

<p> This issue is solved by 
telling LaTeX to be "sloppy" in the way it
deals with whitespace. Simply include

{% raw %}


\sloppy

{% endraw %}

</p><p> in the preamble of the document.
It is also advisable to split up
commas as separate maths delimiters. 
I.e., instead of

</p><p> 
{% raw %}

$\spt X,\ \spt Y$, 

{% endraw %}

</p><p> write 

</p><p> 
{% raw %}

$\spt X$, $\spt Y$. 

{% endraw %}

</p><p> In the former case, the entire block {% raw %} $..$ {% endraw %}
would get pulled to the next line if it were to 
run into the margin, whereas, in the second
situation, the line split would occur at the comma.
