	<dd> I'm primarily interested in the interactions between harmonic analysis
		and geometry, and in particular using harmonic analysis to analyse
		low-regularity situations on manifolds and also vector bundles.
		Currently, I'm interested in  boundary value problems for 
		first-order operators on bundles, using the language of (bi)-sectorial 
		operators. Also: 
	<dd>&nbsp;
  	
    <ul>

	<li> Harmonic analysis - in  the flavour of Calderon, Zygmund, Stein, etc. </li>
	<li> Geometric analysis - analysis on non-compact manifolds, non-smooth metrics, analysis on measure metric spaces, Spin geometry. </li>
	<li> Boundary value problems - first-order boundary value problems on bundles, non-smooth coefficients, non-compact boundary. </li> 
	<li> Spectral and operator theory - essential self-adjointness, asymptotics of eigenvalues, etc. </li>
