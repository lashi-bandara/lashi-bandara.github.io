<p>
<b>What?</b>
</p> 
<p>
This is a one day conference centred on analysis, geometry and their intersection.  
</p>


<p>
<b>Why?</b>
 </p> 
<p>
Global analysis is the marriage of analysis, geometry and operator theory. 
Differential operators encode geometric and topological problems and the analysis of these operators yield powerful geometric results.
It is an area of research recent to Deakin and the goal of the meeting is to bring together interested members of the Australian mathematical community to Deakin.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Who?</b>
</p> 

<p>
The aim of this meeting is to bring together participants with an interest in analysis and geometry from within Australia.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"> This event is open to <b>everyone</b> and in particular, <em>Honours students</em>, <em>PhD students</em> and <em>Postdocs</em> are welcome and invited to attend the event. </span>
</p> 

<p>
Please remember to register for this event by filling out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tinyurl.com/agdrego">THIS REGISTRATION FORM</a>  before 30/11/2025.

<p><b> Talks </b></p>


<ul>
<li> 
<p><em>Global Analysis at Deakin</em></p>

<p>Lashi Bandara</p> 

<p align="justify">
In this short presentation, I will set the context by outlining some of the Global Analysis research being undertaken at Deakin. 
It will also set the context for the remaining external presentations.
</p>

<li>
<p><em>The intermediate nonlinear Schrödinger equation</em></p>

<p>Justin Forlano</p> 

<p align="justify">

In this talk, I will discuss recent results regarding the intermediate nonlinear Schrödinger equation (INLS). Analytically speaking, INLS is a one-dimensional completely integrable nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a cubic derivative nonlinearity and is $L^2$-critical. A limiting form of INLS is the continuum Calogero-Moser equation (CCM), which is also completely integrable. Interestingly, CCM keeps the Hardy space $L^2_+$ invariant, and, under this assumption, tools from complete integrability have recently resolved the well-posedness problem for CCM in $L^2_+$. I will discuss progress on the well-posedness for INLS and CCM (not relying on complete integrability), outside of the Hardy space and in low-regularity. Our approach combines a gauge transformation, bilinear Strichartz estimates and a refined decomposition for smooth solutions. This is based on joint work with A. Chapouto (CNRS, UVSQ) and T. Laurens (UW-Madison).

<p><em>  Recent developments on stability for the elastic flow of curves </em></p>

<p> Glen Wheeler </p>


<p align="justify">
The free elastic flow is the $L^2(ds)$ steepest descent gradient flow for Euler’s elastic energy defined on curves. Among closed curves, circles and the lemniscate of Bernoulli expand self-similarly under the elastic flow, and there are no stationary solutions. This means that any stabilising effect must be modulo a rescaling that fixes, for instance, length. This additional difficulty has led authors (following Euler) to introduce a constraint or a penalisation in the energy, which changes the dynamics substantially. In particular, there are a plethora of stability and convergence results in a variety of settings, both planar and space, and with a number of boundary conditions. The free elastic flow itself remained untouched, until recently: In 2024, joint with Miura, we were able to establish convergence of the asymptotic profile, through the use of a new quantity depending on the derivative of the curvature. Then, in 2025, joint with Andrews, this has been improved and a sharp convergence rate has been obtained. In this talk, I describe these new results, and also explain what more may be on the horizon for the free elastic flow. If time permits I will also talk about our initial work on the space curve case, where an unexpected phenomenon related to turning number appears.
