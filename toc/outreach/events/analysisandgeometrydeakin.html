<p>
<b>What?</b>
</p> 
<p>
This is a one day conference centered on analysis, geometry and their intersection.  
</p>


<p>
<b>Why?</b>
 </p> 
<p>
Global analysis is the marriage of analysis, geometry and operator theory. 
Differential operators encode geometric and topological problems and the analysis of these operators yeild powerful geometric results.
</p> 

<p>
<b>Who?</b>
</p> 

<p>
The aim of this meeting is to bring together participants with an interest in analysis and geometry from within Australia.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"> This event is open to <b>everyone</b> and in particular,<em>Honours students</em>, <em>PhD students</em> and <em>Postdocs</em> are welcome and invited to attend the event. </span>
</p> 

<p>

</p> 

<p> There will be three invited talks given in total. The host (Lashi Bandara) will give a short mathematical introduction to set the context, particularly for mathematics at Deakin. The invited speakers are:

<!-- TALKS:
<ul>
<li> 
<p><em>Manifolds, Operators, Estimates</em></p>

<p>Lashi Bandara</p> 

<p align="justify">
Broadly speaking, global analysis is the term used to describe the way geometric problems can be formulated, understood, and resolved through the use of differential operators and mathematical analysis.
More often that not, these geometric problems arise from physical situations, such as the study of the electron or other fundamental particle in the presence of gravity.
<br><br>  

I will discuss a particular aspect: when we consider a differential operator acting between sections of vector bundles over a manifold with boundary.
In this case, the operator has two distinguished extensions, the maximal and the minimal, with the latter contained in the former. 
The study of all possible extensions of the minimal operator contained in the maximal one is equivalent to the study of boundary conditions.
Obtaining trace theorems provide a tangible two way road between these extensions and boundary conditions.
My ambition will be to relate this example to the areas of the three speakers in the afternoon.
</p>

<li>
<p><em>New progress on solvability of Regularity problem for elliptic
operators with coefficients satisfying large Carleson condition</em></p>

<p>Martin Dindoš</p> 

<p align="justify">
Recall that when $Lu=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ and coefficients A satisfy Carleson
condition (that is $|\nabla A|^2\delta$ is a Carleson measure) then the
corresponding elliptic measure is $A_\infty$ and hence the $L^p$
Dirichlet problem is solvable for some large $p &lt; \infty$. There is also
an analogous smallness result, namely that  on $C^1$ domains $L^p$
Dirichlet problem is solvable for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, provided $|\nabla
A|^2\delta$ is a vanishing Carleson measure.
<br><br> 
 
In the case of Regularity problem, the analogous smallness result was
established in Dindos-Pipher-Rule. We have recently (jointly with S.
Hofmann and J. Pipher) established an n-dimensional reduction that
relates solvability of Regularity problem to the solvability of
Regularity problem for a block-form operator.

<br><br>  
This reduction has allowed us to fully resolve the question of
solvability of Regularity problem with coefficients satisfying large
Carleson condition in all dimensions and also the Neumann problem in
dimension 2 in the interval for $1&lt;p&lt;1+\epsilon$.

<br><br> 
Remarkably, Mourgoglou, Poggi and Tolsa have considered the same
question from a different perspective using new ideas that allow
extrapolation of the small Carleson result of Dindos-Pipher-Rule using
improved version of Mourgoglou Tolsa decomposition of domains to
Lipschitz subdomains (developed for originally for the Regularity
problem for Laplacian). This method allows to consider the Regularity
problem for more general domains (beyond Lipschitz).

I compare the two methods and outline possible further open questions
that might be addressed thanks to these exciting developments.

<li>
<p><em>Algebraic and analytic aspects of renormalisation</em></p>

<p> Kasia Rejzner </p>


<p align="justify">
In this talk I will discuss recent progress in understanding mathematical foundations of renormalization. The approach I'm going to focus on is Epstein-Glaser renormalisation combined with ideas of local covariance, to allow for construction of quantum field theory models on curved spacetimes. The resulting framework is called perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em> Global stability of spacetimes with supersymmetric compactifications </em></p>

<p> Zoe Wyatt</p>


<p align="justify">
 Spacetimes with compact directions which have special holonomy, such as Calabi-Yau spaces, play an important role in supergravity and string theory. In this talk I will discuss a work with Andersson, Blue and Yau, where we show the global, nonlinear stability a spacetime which is a cartesian product of a high dimensional Minkowski space with a compact Ricci flat internal space with special holonomy. This stability result is related to a conjecture of Penrose concerning the validity of string theory. </p>
