<p>
<b>What?</b>
</p> 
<p>
This is a one day conference around global analysis, with a particular emphasis on methods from modern harmonic analysis, geometry, mathematical physics and their interaction.  
</p>


<p>
<b>Why?</b>
 </p> 
<p>
Global analysis sits on the intersection of geometry, operator theory and analysis. 
Many of the questions are encoded using differential operators on vector bundles, which then are the objects of study typically using methods from analysis.
These problems themselves often arise from mathematical physics. 
</p> 

<p>
In the recent past, methods from real-variable harmonic analysis have found a footing in global analysis.
Coupled with the bounded holomorphic functional calculus, they have allowed for the resolution of problems where there is non-compactness and non-smoothness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Who?</b>
</p> 

<p>
The aim of this meeting is to bring together participants who have interest in global analysis and related areas.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"> This event is open to <b>everyone</b> and in particular, <em>PhD students</em> and <em>postdocs</em> are welcome and invited to attend the event. </span>

<p><b> Talks </b></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>New progress on solvability of Regularity problem for elliptic
operators with coefficients satisfying large Carleson condition</em></p>

<p>Martin Dindoš<p> 

<p align="justify">
Recall that when $Lu=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ and coefficients A satisfy Carleson
condition (that is $|\nabla A|^2\delta$ is a Carleson measure) then the
corresponding elliptic measure is $A_\infty$ and hence the $L^p$
Dirichlet problem is solvable for some large $p &lt; \infty$. There is also
an analogous smallness result, namely that  on $C^1$ domains $L^p$
Dirichlet problem is solvable for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, provided $|\nabla
A|^2\delta$ is a vanishing Carleson measure.

In the case of Regularity problem, the analogous smallness result was
established in Dindos-Pipher-Rule. We have recently (jointly with S.
Hofmann and J. Pipher) established an n-dimensional reduction that
relates solvability of Regularity problem to the solvability of
Regularity problem for a block-form operator.

This reduction has allowed us to fully resolve the question of
solvability of Regularity problem with coefficients satisfying large
Carleson condition in all dimensions and also the Neumann problem in
dimension 2 in the interval for $1&lt;p&lt;1+\epsilon$.

Remarkably, Mourgoglou, Poggi and Tolsa have considered the same
question from a different perspective using new ideas that allow
extrapolation of the small Carleson result of Dindos-Pipher-Rule using
improved version of Mourgoglou Tolsa decomposition of domains to
Lipschitz subdomains (developed for originally for the Regularity
problem for Laplacian). This method allows to consider the Regularity
problem for more general domains (beyond Lipschitz).

I compare the two methods and outline possible further open questions
that might be addressed thanks to these exciting developments.

<p><em>Algebraic and analytic aspects of renormalisation</em></p>

<p> Kasia Rejzner </p>


<p align="justify">
In this talk I will discuss recent progress in understanding mathematical foundations of renormalization. The approach I'm going to focus on is Epstein-Glaser renormalisation combined with ideas of local covariance, to allow for construction of quantum field theory models on curved spacetimes. The resulting framework is called perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em> Global stability of spacetimes with supersymmetric compactifications </em></p>

<p> Zoe Wyatt</p>


<p align="justify">
 Spacetimes with compact directions which have special holonomy, such as Calabi-Yau spaces, play an important role in supergravity and string theory. In this talk I will discuss a work with Andersson, Blue and Yau, where we show the global, nonlinear stability a spacetime which is a cartesian product of a high dimensional Minkowski space with a compact Ricci flat internal space with special holonomy. This stability result is related to a conjecture of Penrose concerning the validity of string theory. </p>
